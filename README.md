# Target_Repository
Repository for API Consumption case study

This repository houses the file `route.js`. This node application allows users to look up the arrival time for the next Metro Transit train or bus for their desired route, stop, and direction directly in their CLI.

To run, clone repository and install necessary node dependencies by running `npm install` in the command line. The user just needs to run the following code in their CLI to check next arrival time: `node route.js`.
